# Explanation : The sliding window algorithm does not make sense intuitively 
# but when the window slides at one point in time the window will have a length of max substring without repeating characters. 
# The problem is just to find the length not the exact substring, hence we can just use a sliding window. 
# If we are to find the exact substring then this wont work because the set stores just unique characters 
# and not the exact arrangement or the exact substring         
# For example :
# substring  - "auryasgiwoa"
# In this the substring will be "auryasgiwo" . 
# Now if we run the code when the end pointer reaches position 10(last a) the set size is already  9. 
# Now ideally it should delete the 'a' at point 5 but what window does is it removes u from the list. 
# Now ideally the set should add two 'a''s in the set but the set never adds additional 'a' since the set stores only unique values. 
# So even though the end pointer is at position 10 the size of the set will be 8 because of the set property.
